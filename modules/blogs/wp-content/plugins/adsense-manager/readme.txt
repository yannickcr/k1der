== Description ==

AdSense Manager is a Wordpress plugin for managing AdSense ads on your blog. It generates code automatically and allows positioning with Widgets.

It previously had a Be Nice feature to support development but this was deemed in violation of Google T&Cs and removed. If you are using an earlier version, please UPGRADE NOW!

Version 2.2 supports: Referral Ads (Text & Image), Direct Code Ads (allows for non AdSense ad positioning), Code Converter (import Google generated Ads to configurable Ad units), Sidebar Modules (as used in the popular K2 theme).

In addition to this Google have reinstated my AdSense account, meaning I can continue to develop the plugin. I'm currently between-houses and using a mobile-phone for net access: Once I'm back online this plugin will continue to be developed - get your feature requests in!
