NextGEN Gallery is a full integrated Image Gallery plugin for WordPress with a Flash slideshow option.

== Description ==

My last and hopefully best plugin for WordPress is a new Gallery plugin called NextGEN Gallery . It's named als "NextGeneration" according to the the development of the game consoles . More over it should indicate that I (try) to use all new possibilities of the great JQuery and the so called Web 2.0. 
Before I start writing the plugin I study all image and gallery plugins for WordPress, I figure out that some of them are really good and well designed, but I missed a simple and easy administration back end to handle multiple galleries.

Features:

* Sortable Albums : Create your own sets of images 
* Upload a Zip-File with pictures : Upload pictures in a zip-file (Not in Safe-mode) 
* Watermark function : You can add a watermark image or text 
* JavaScript Effect : Use any available popular image effect : Thickbox, Lightbox or Highslide
* Multiple CSS Stylesheet : Use a nice shadow effect for your thumbnails with your own CSS file
